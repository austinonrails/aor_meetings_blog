# SXSW WEB DEVELOPER HAPPY HOUR!

Please join us on the Monday of SXSW for good conversation, appetizers, and a night out without the laptop.  Buffalo Billiards has tons of games, such as darts, billiards, and shuffleboard. 

We invited bonafide web geek and designer [Alex Baldwin](http://alexbaldwin.com) to DJ our event.

It's easily the best party for the HTTP set.  

Web developers of all stripes are welcome!  The venue is 21+.

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Ticketbud is handmade right here in Austin, Texas!

We could not put on this event without the gracious help of our awesome sponsors.
