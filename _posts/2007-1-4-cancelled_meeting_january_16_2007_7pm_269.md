When: January 16, 2007 @ 7PM

_ [When: January 23, 2007 @ 7PM](http://www.austinonrails.org/2007/01/15/meeting-january-23-2007-7pm)_

Austin's own (not for long) Tony Perrie would like to introduce us to Xaggly, a new C-based XML Parser for Ruby that he has written. In unbiased benchmarking tests against [REXML](http://www.germane-software.com/software/rexml/) and [Hpricot](http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/), it appears to [run quite speedily](http://involution.com/images/xmlshootout.png).

The source code is here: [http://involution.com/xaggly.tar.gz](http://involution.com/xaggly.tar.gz)

Tony Perrie, originally a hardware engineer by trade, switched to the Web Application game in 2006. He currently spends his time equally divided between that and searching for a Markov chain of genetic algorithms that will cause the universe to segmentation fault.

We are delighted to have Hal Fulton, our resident [Austin Ruby](http://austinruby.com/) historian, giving a talk entitled "Programming Habits for Rubyists".

Hal Fulton has two degrees in computer science and twenty years of industry experience. He is the author of The Ruby Way and has been using Ruby since 1999.

We will also be giving away a copy of Hal's new book [The Ruby Way](http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Way-Second-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0672328844/) for the raffle.

See you there!
