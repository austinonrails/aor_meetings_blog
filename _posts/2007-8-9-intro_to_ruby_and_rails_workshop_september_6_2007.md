We are having an introductory Ruby and Rails workshop the night before the Lone Star Ruby Conference. Admission to the workshop is for you to [make a donation](http://www.changingthepresent.org/registries/show/412) to one or more of the charities we are supporting:

- **Habitat for Humanity**
- **Lance Armstrong Foundation**
- **Muscular Dystrophy Association**
- **Capital Area Food Bank**
- **Ruby Central**
 We’ve already raised over $800 in the first week, which is wonderful, but we are far from our goal of $2500. We would _greatly appreciate_ your support with these endeavors. The speaker list for the evening workshop (9/6, 6-10PM) is as follows: 
- **hal fulton** - ruby overview
- **james edward gray ii** - blocks
- **bret pettichord** - testing in ruby
- **marcel molina, jr** - why i <3 ruby
- **bruce tate** - rails overview
- **bruce williams** - taming your views
- **rick olson** - active record for the masses
- **robert rasmussen** - 30 minutes rails live demo
 We can’t wait to get everyone together for this event. 

Please join us! Thank you.

**NOTE: Lone Star Ruby Conference pricing goes up after August 10th to $300. You can save $100 by registering this week!**
