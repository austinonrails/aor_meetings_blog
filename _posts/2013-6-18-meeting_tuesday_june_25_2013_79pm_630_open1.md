Welcome to summer, Rails Aficionados!

Part-Time Comedian and Full-Time Developer Mando Escamilla is your Rails Conductor this month.

## Mando Escamilla - Tell Us Another Story, Grandpa: Lessons Learned Over 16 Years as a Developer

The software development world is a twisty maze of passages, all alike (at first glance). It can be slightly perilous and a little scary, especially if you’re just starting out. What kind of job should you be looking for? What skills do you need? How much should you ask for?

Well, Mando doesn’t know any of that stuff :). BUT Mando has been around the block more than a few times and he’d like to share what I’ve learned over the past 16 years.

Mando is a righteous dude that works as a Gentleman Developer at Union Metrics. He’s got three amazing kids and two extra-large dogs so he must be doing something right.

## Austin Hughey - What is in Rails 4?

Rails version 4 is well on its way. RC2 has already shipped, and if no major blockers are found with that version, the core team intends to ship an actual release on June 25. This presentation will cover some (but not all) of the more salient changes and new features in the framework.

J. Austin Hughey (you can just call him Austin) is a devops engineer at Engine Yard and has been working with Ruby for about 5 years and Linux for longer. He organizes Austin’s OpenHack (also at Capital Factory) and enjoys, among other things, video games in his spare time, as well as Krav Maga which he recently picked back up after a long hiatus.

Looking forward to seeing you there!
