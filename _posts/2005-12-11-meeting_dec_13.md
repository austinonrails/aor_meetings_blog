Our [first meeting](/articles/2006/02/13/first-meeting-nov-15-at-7pm) was a blast — 21 people gathered for a decidedly friendly meeting. We’re getting together again to discuss Ruby and Rails, please join us for presentations followed by a social hour at Hickory Street Bar & Grill.

### Presentations

#### ActiveRecord Migrations in Rails

You may have seen how easy it is to get started with a simple database for your Rails application. But what happens as it needs to grow? Eric explores how Rails migrations can be used whether you are just beginning your application, maintaining a production system, or wanting to port an existing application to Rails.
