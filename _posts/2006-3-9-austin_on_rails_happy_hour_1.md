We’d like to remind everyone to please come on out to the Austin on Rails Happy Hour at [Buffalo Billiards](http://buffalobilliards.com/austin/) (6th and Congress) on Saturday, March 11th from 6-8pm. We’ll have some drink tickets (if you get there early) and food will be available for purchase. Pool tables, shuffleboard, and foosball will also be available in our private room. The [event is on upcoming.org](http://upcoming.org/event/58162/) if you’d like to let us know you’re coming. We’d also like to thank [Michael Buffington](http://www.michaelbuffington.com/) for his help with the party. We look forward to seeing you there this weekend!
