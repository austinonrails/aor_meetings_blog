_edit_ Ugh, 2013! Changed the title. Thanks Aaron from San Antonio!

Welcome to 2013, Compadres!

Brrrrrr!!!!! When you want to take a break from freezing your you-know-what off, come on out to Austin on Rails and hang out in the warm glow of Rails knowledge in the @capitalfactory!

**Beginner Talk: Daniel Hedrick, Intro to Capybara**

We build web applications. But often times, we get lost in code and we might not be paying attention to what effects our changes actually have. The surest way to ensure we _really_ didn’t break anything is to run through a “smoke test” but that takes time. And who really wants to click the same links over and over and fill out the same forms, _over and over_? **Capybara to the rescue!** Daniel will show us how to get Capybara installed and walk through building a simple smoke test for an application. Now, every time changes get made, we can ensure the web pages continue to work, but without all that time-consuming click-click-submit.

Daniel has been programming off and on since he was 12 years old (using LOGO to draw pictures of the Starship Enterprise on a TI-99/4A). For the last 3 years, he’s been writing Ruby and Rails software and gotten bit by not performing a smoke test more than once. In his spare time (HA!), he reads pulp science fiction and scares his dogs by shouting at the TV during football games.

**Advanced Talk: Nathan Ladd, Deeper Refactorings**

Often times when we think about refactoring, we conjure up an image of a presentation where the speaker masterfully wrangles an ugly looking mutant of a method into submission. But in the real world, the problem often extends beyond a single method. To make matters worse, the existing test suite is coupled tightly to an existing implementation that is fundamentally flawed, and becomes more of a burden than an aid. I know I need a safety net, and look to automated browser tests to fill that need, but there are a few hurdles in the way. I’ll explore how to overcome those challenges, as well as how fixtures and factories both fall short of empowering us to rethink our model layer.

Nathan has been slinging ruby code since 2008, and has been writing software professionally since 2005. He worked at MindBites until last year, where he helped build out a robust online video platform and marketplace for paid instructional content. Recently, he has been spotted at PeopleAdmin, helping build out an enterprise software stack on top of Ruby. When not writing code, he enjoys playing guitar, sampling new craft brews, practicing yoga, and playing video games.

Hope to see y’all there!
