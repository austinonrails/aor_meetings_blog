(We are forgoing the December Austin on Rails meeting to participate in the Austin Web Bash)

Following in our grand tradition, we plan to get together with the rest of the Austin web and tech community for a giant holiday party. Come escape from the stress of end-of-year deadlines and impending familial obligations with some great drinks and awesome people.

Each year participation has grown, and we’re very proud that what started out as a small gathering now includes over 25 active groups spanning a wide swath of the Austin Web and Tech community. Last year over 800 people joined us. This year we’re we’ve got more space and our sponsors are helping us make it even bigger!

In line with participation from so many groups, awesome local businesses have stepped up to sponsor the event, providing a bar tab and covering other party-related costs.

Austin is an amazing town filled with inspiring people and groups. You should come hang out with all of them on December 10th.
