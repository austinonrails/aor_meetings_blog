### Party On

Come on over to Dave & Busters and help us celebrate a year of ridin’ the Rails. Our group is just one year old and we are now looking ahead to 2007. Before we ring in the new year, let’s take a moment to hang out and enjoy ourselves. We’ll have a full fajita buffet, some game cards, 2 billiards tables, and a shuffleboard table all to ourselves. A cash bar will also be available.

### Details
 WHERE: Dave & Busters (Mopac and 183) 

WHEN: Tuesday, December 12th, 7-11PM

### Offering A Helping Hand

I had a vision the other night. In this vision, Austin On Rails not only fed themselves fajitas, but they also fed the hungry in Austin. It is with this in mind, that I ask you to please bring a food donation as admission to the party. I will deliver our donation to CAFB.

### Donation Ideas
 These are the most commonly requested items at the [Capital Area Food Bank](http://www.austinfoodbank.org/): 

    HTML parse error: 
    <ul>
    <li>canned meats like tuna, stew and chili (pop-tops
    preferred)</li>
    <li>canned green beans, canned corn and other canned
    vegetables</li>
    <li>pasta & pasta sauce</li>
    <li>pinto beans</li>
    <li>rice</li>
    <li>healthy cereal</li>
    <li>peanut butter</li>
    <li>baby food & baby formula</li>
    </ul>

 These are just suggestions. Please bring what you can. 
### Our Sponsor
 I’d like to take this opportunity to thank Steven Smith and the whole [FiveRuns](http://fiveruns.com/) team for their generous offering of support. Without it, this celebration could not have happened!
