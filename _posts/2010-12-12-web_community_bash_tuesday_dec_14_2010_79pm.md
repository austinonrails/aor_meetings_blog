Howdy Folks!

We will not have an official Austin on Rails meeting this month due to the holiday season. However, you can escape the end-of-year madness for a few hours this Tuesday night (12/14). Come hang out with fellow Web professionals at the [Austin Web Community Holiday Bash](http://refreshaustin.org/bash). It’s a chance to catch up with old friends and make some new friends. We’ve expanded a good bit from years past and are co-hosting the event with ten other groups. Ten! I _love_ this town.

Giant thanks to the good folks at [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com) for sponsoring drinks and [BuildASign](http://www.buildasign.com) for sponsoring the bartenders who will make them!

So, come on out to have fun with Austin’s best Web communities: WordPress Austin, Austin on Rails, Austin JavaScript, IxDA-Austin, Austin UPA, Austin Lean Startup Circle, the Web Design Meetup, Bootstrap Austin Interactive, Austin Drupal Newbie Meetup, Austin PHP Meetup and Refresh Austin.

7 - 9pm, Tuesday, December 14th, 2010  
 @ Buffalo Billiards (6th and Brazos)  
  [Spread the word on Facebook](http://on.fb.me/AustinWebBash)!

Admission: One or more canned food items for the [Capital Area Food Bank](http://www.austinfoodbank.org/).

See you on Tuesday!
