### How I Roll: A Cucumber/git Workflow

Following on the heels of last month’s Cucumber talk, this discussion will outline an effective workflow for constructing your Rails projects utilizing Cucumber and git. The Outside-In model of Rails development will serve as a template for rapidly producing the greatest code the world has ever seen. If you’re a consultant trying to find a better way to engage your clients in the development process, or if you’re just looking for a good way to wrap your head around this Cucumber business the kids have been chattering about, then this is right up your alley.

Matt Buck is a consultant and Ruby hacker for Capital Thought, the folks behind OtherInbox. He has been working professionally with Rails since 2006.

### Processing Large Datasets with Ruby and Hadoop

We’re living in Douglas Adam’s future. We have the answers to Life, the Universe, and Everything (or at the very least, have petabytes of data about it), but until recently we’ve lacked the ability to effectively _ask questions_ of this data.

There’s a new approach – the Map-Reduce programming paradigm – that lets you surf this tsunami. What’s more, it’s cheap, accessible and fun. Flip Kromer will show how to use Wukong (a Ruby framework for the Hadoop map/reduce architecture) to explore the structure of Twitter’s friend graph. With simple scripts and a bit of patience, Wukong can not only do stuff like “parse 1TB of raw feed data” but also help you ask questions such as “For each of the 20M+ users, what words do they use most frequently (relative to everyone else)?” and “Who are the most influential users?” (the pagerank algorithm).

Flip started infochimps.org (a website to find any dataset in the world), and is currently finishing up grad school at UT. His research work involves smashing massive datasets together and finding science in what falls out. When I’m not doing all that, I enjoy bowling and old cars.
