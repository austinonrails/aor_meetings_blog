Yes, we are having a meeting this month! I apologize for my tardiness in posting this note.

This month we’re going to go into the finer points of creating Rails forms with a screencast from Pragmatic called “Forms Essentials”. They’ve been gracious enough to give us permission to show the episode to our group. It’s a part of their [Mastering Rails Forms](http://pragprog.com/screencasts/v-rbforms/mastering-rails-forms) series. We are also going to get an overview of [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org), a “distributed, fault-tolerant and schema-free document-oriented database accessible via a RESTful HTTP/JSON API”, implemented in Erlang. Here’s a [technical overview](http://couchdb.apache.org/docs/overview.html) if you want to read up on it.

## Part One

Episode 1: Form Essentials (30 minutes)

We’ll start by building a search form, and then move on to a form for ordering custom pizzas. The pizza form starts out with a simple text field and checkbox, but ends up with a pull-down menu for the pizza crust type (a one-to-many association) and a group of checkboxes for the pizza toppings (a many-to-many association).

You’ll learn how to:

- use various form helpers to create form fields
- create forms that are backed by Active Record models using form_for_
- create forms that aren’t backed by a model using form_tag_
- set default and initial values in form fields
- use form field values in the params hash
- prevent a common security problem related to mass-assignment
- create pull-down menus for one-to-many associations
- use checkboxes for many-to-many associations

## Part Deux

Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve probably heard of something called [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org). Here we’ll answer all your questions like: What is it? How do I use it with Ruby? Why should I care? Does it like to party? We’ll cover a history of CouchDB, how to set it up, and how to get started using it today!

Brian Smith is a principal at [Downtown Cartel](http://downtowncartel.com/) where he works on cool and exciting stuff all the time. He also is one of the brains behind [hashtags](http://hashtags.org/). He is really interested in problems involving deep data analysis and distributed computing. 

As per usual, we will be meeting in the offices of Datran Media/OtherInbox on the 8th floor of the Omni Hotel Building (enter by the stairs at 7th and Brazos). Please show up early to get a good seat!
