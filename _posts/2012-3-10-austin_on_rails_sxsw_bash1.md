Please join us for our Austin on Rails SXSW Bash this Monday night.

Rails geeks unite! We’ll be sharing good conversation, games (billiards, shuffleboard, and darts), cold beverages, and light appetizers while the guys from 500 Startups Console.fm spin some tunes.

We’ll also have a dedicated gaming room to ourselves with an old school game collection including Mission Control, etc. They will also have XBox set up on a large screen for our use.

Would like to send out a huge thank you to all of our awesome sponsors making this possible. Spiceworks and OtherInbox are sponsoring at the Platinum level and will have tables set up at the event. A big thank you as well to PeopleAdmin and Chargify for supporting our community!

The event will run from 8-10PM at Buffalo Billiards on Monday, March 12th.

Please join us!
