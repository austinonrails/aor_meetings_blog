February is lightning talk month!

We are having lightning talks as our topic this month. These are 5 minute long talks that can cover anything you want: Rails, Ruby, even Javascript!

Last year we had a talks on Vim, Rack, Docker, bacon, and the Hacker Diet, among others. If you're thinking about submitting a talk, [check out last year's talks to get inspired](https://github.com/austinonrails/members/wiki/February-2016-Lightning-List).
