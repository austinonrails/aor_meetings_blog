In lieu of our December meeting, we are going to celebrate our 2nd Anniversary as a group by having a holiday party. Yes, it’s become an annual tradition by now…and a darn fine one at that.

We are going to meet at [Buffalo Billiards](http://www.buffalobilliards.com/austin) on 6th Street ( [map](http://tinyurl.com/3xbays)) on Tuesday, December 11th from 6 to 9 PM. We currently don't have any official party sponsorship this year, so we are going to just meet up and grab some pool tables and hang out downtown at Buffalo. Should be fun!

Last year, we donated about 95 pounds of food to the CAFB (Capital Area Food Bank) and I think it would be great if we could do it again. So please, bring some non-perishable food items with you to Buffalo. I'll gather them all and then drop them off at the center. Thanks so much!

**Looking forward to hanging out with you all (!)** next week and shooting some pool while partaking in the beverage of your choice. :)

_P.S. I'm looking for a few volunteers who are willing to meet me down there at 5:30 so we can grab up a couple of tables together. Please send me an email if you can help do this._
