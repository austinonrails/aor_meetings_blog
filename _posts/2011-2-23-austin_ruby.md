The most popular choice for the night of the month was the Third Thursday, a night which currently has no other known conflicts with other technical groups in town.

There wasn’t a majority for any location, and it was a close race between OtherInbox and Norris. Given that Cospace and Norris are a little over a mile apart, I am going to presume that a vote for Cospace is a vote for a more Central Austin location, or a vote for meeting somewhere different than Austin on Rails currently does.

So, let’s move forward with that night (3rd Thursdays) and that space (Norris Conference Center) as the plan.

Given that SXSW is just around the corner and there’s still some infrastructure to set up for the group, the earliest the first meeting could be held would be in April. What this group is going to be like is really up to the members. For those of you who are interested, I hope that you will share your thoughts about what you would like _austin.rb_ to be like with Mattt Thompson (a.k.a. [@mattt](http://twitter.com/mattt) on Twitter).

A final note to all Rubyists in Austin (and surrounding areas)…please join us for our Happy Hour during SXSW. Thanks to some generous sponsors, we are going to be able to have a great gathering again this year. You can [RSVP over here](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=190450464316514) to let us know you’re coming. I hope you will come out and join us.
