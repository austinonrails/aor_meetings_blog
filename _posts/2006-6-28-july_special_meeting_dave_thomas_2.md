#### The Details

Event: Austin on Rails Evening with Dave Thomas  
 Date: Thursday, July 6, 2006  
 Time: 7 p.m. - 9 p.m.  
 Location: UT Campus  
 Room: [Taylor Hall](http://www.utexas.edu/maps/main/buildings/tay.html) 2.106

#### The Speaker
 
 

Dave Thomas is a well-known software development expert, particularly in the Ruby community. He helped write the Agile Manifesto. He is the author of many books, including the best selling The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master, Programming Ruby: A Pragmatic Programmer's Guide, and Agile Web Development With Rails.

#### Event Parking

2 blocks away from Taylor Hall, there are 2 parking garages:

- [SWG](http://www.utexas.edu/maps/main/buildings/swg.html)
- [TSG](http://www.utexas.edu/maps/main/buildings/tsg.html)

There are usually spots open around San Jacinto and 24th. Parking shouldn't be a huge problem since it is summer. There is some parking around the building but you want to make sure you read the signs so you don't get a parking ticket.

#### Acknowledgments

We'd like to send out a very special thanks to Tina Wang, Joshua Shanks, Justin Perkins (for the initial contact), and the UT ACM for hosting our meeting in the auditorium.

**UPDATE: I've added this event to upcoming.org if you'd like to [rsvp over there now](http://upcoming.org/event/88447/).**
