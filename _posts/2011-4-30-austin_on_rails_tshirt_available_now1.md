Awesome News! [Barry Cox](http://twitter.com/rubyminer) and [Carlos Cabrera](http://twitter.com/carlos_atx) (the designer of the AoR logo) have put together a [web site](http://aorshirts.com/) to buy the new Austin on Rails shirt!

We are rushing through the first order (must order before Monday, 5/2) so that those going to Railsconf can show their Austin pride.
