Lance Vaughn is a local Rails developer who wants to do what he can to promote Austin and the Rails communities. As a part of that work, he’s going to be doing some blogging for Austin on Rails. The feature below is a Twitter interview which he recently conducted with Steve Odom about his new Rails-based site, which is launching at [DEMO](http://www.demo.com/) this week in San Diego.

**LANCE: Hey, Steve. Thanks for accepting my invitation for a twinterview. I’m looking forward to getting to know more about you and [ge.la.to](http://ge.la.to/)!**

_STEVE: Hi Lance, I look forward to chatting with you._

**LANCE: Cool. You recently tweeted that you love pitching ideas. What is your standard ten-second elevator-style pitch for Gelato?**

_STEVE: Gelato is realtime search meets online dating. Think Friendfeed for dating._

**LANCE: Nice. Okay. Seems like a unique idea. But sell me. What’s your angle? How will Gelato succeed?**

_STEVE: I was a heavy user of dating sites (after a divorce). I built Gelato because I wanted something different. Simpler._

_STEVE: For Gelato to succeed, I’m listening & iterating. Rinsing & repeating._

**LANCE: So, I know that Gelato is a startup. Do you have any funding to speak of? What stage is it in today?**

_STEVE: Bootstrapping! ATX startup community makes it easy. Lots of support. Gelato is alpha stage. Launch beta at DEMO._

**LANCE: How exciting! Congratulations, man! Can you tell us more about how you won the opportunity to participate in DEMO?**

_STEVE: Pretty simple actually. I applied, had a phone interview, gave them a demo, and I was invited. Very excited._

**LANCE: If your every dream for Gelato came true, what would it look like for you and/or for your users?**

_STEVE: I want Gelato to be a paradigm changer. Bring real-time search to dating. Match the authenticity & speed of offline dating._

**LANCE: I really like the idea of using on-line profiles to validate a person’s authenticity. Tell us how SCOOP Points work.**

_STEVE: Online dating suffers from fake profiles & married people saying they’re single. SCOOP = Social Confidence of Online Profile._

_STEVE: You get more SCOOP points for adding auth accounts, # of friends you have on networks, & your friends vouching for you._

**LANCE: Very cool idea, Steve! So, what’s the hardest lesson you’ve learned along the way? What helped you the most as you bootstrapped?**

_STEVE: What helped me the most as a bootstrapper is having awesome friends providing support. eg [@jbritten](http://twitter.com/jbritten)’s technical founder group._

_STEVE: and [@damon](http://twitter.com/damon)’s [Cafe Bedouins](http://cafebedouins.com). The [AOR](http://austinonrails.org/) group. Groups like [@conjunctured](http://twitter.com/conjunctured) and [@techranch](http://twitter.com/techranch)._

**LANCE: Wow. It’s becoming clear that Austin has a really supportive community for startups. Any other Austin Rails startups going to DEMO?**

_STEVE: I’m not sure I’m supposed to say. But, yes, I know of 3 others. Two of which are Rails-based._

**LANCE: Go Rails! Thanks for the interview, Steve. Best of luck to you and your Gelato project!**
