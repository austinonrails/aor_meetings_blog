# Meeting Details

Come on out this month to Datran Media at 7th and Brazos (just inside the doors, there is a bank of elevators; head to the 8th floor). As we tend to do, we will be meeting on the fourth Tuesday of the month to discuss Ruby and Rails for a couple of hours. Afterwards we will adjourn to the local pub to continue the conversations. Make sure you arrive a bit early to get a good spot!

Mike will demonstrate the SproutCore framework for building web clients that talk to Rails applications in a true client-server fashion. SproutCore makes heavy use of Ruby, and provides an elegant, Rails-like way of constructing a web app that is radically different than current web 2.0 techniques. Then we'll take things to the whiteboard for a behind-the-scenes in-depth look at cloud computing architectures, and how OtherInbox is using cloud computing to scale Rails.

Mike Subelsky is co-founder and lead developer of OtherInbox.com, a web application he built using Rails and SproutCore. Prior to becoming a full-time Rails hacker, he served as a U.S. Navy information warfare officer with overseas assignments around the world for seven years. He is the author of random-data, an open-source Ruby gem used for prototyping new Ruby applications, and two of his recipes are featured in the book Advanced Rails Recipes. He holds Bachelor and Master of Information Systems Management degrees from Carnegie Mellon University, and is a Certified Information Systems Security Professional. He blogs about Ruby on Rails at subelsky.com.

# Tacos Con Web (NEW!)

If you work with the web and you’re in the downtown area on the 25th, please come over to El Chilito on Congress from 9:30-10:30am to talk web technology and grab some tacos. If you have friends who work in the web space (doesn’t have to be Rails), please invite them to this new get together on Fourth Tuesdays. Thanks!
