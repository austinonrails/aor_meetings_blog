# ORM Deathmatch!

by [Mike Perham](http://www.mikeperham.com/)

ActiveRecord isn't the only game in town when it comes time to access your database with Ruby. We'll take ActiveRecord, [DataMapper](http://datamapper.org) and [Sequel](http://code.google.com/p/ruby-sequel/), put them in a steel cage match to the death and see who emerges victorious. Attendees in the first three rows might get bloody so bring a poncho.

Mike is a Ruby developer at [FiveRuns](http://www.fiveruns.com) and faints at the sight of blood.

# [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/Home) - a Tiny Ruby Web Framework

by [Damon Clinkscales](http://damonclinkscales.com/)

There are times when Rails seems like massive overkill, but you would still like to use Ruby goodness. This is especially true when your entire web site idea can be contained inside one file. We'll take a look at the features of Sinatra and play around with a sample application based upon it.

Damon is software engineer (doing mostly Ruby and Rails work since 2005) for [VitalSource Technologies](http://vitalsource.com/). He also recently created a [Twitter](http://twitter.com/)/ [Flickr](http://flickr.com/) mashup called [SnapTweet](http://snaptweet.com/) and is the leader of the Austin On Rails user group.

The meeting will be held at Datran Media @ 7th & Brazos - meet at the elevators. Socialization practice to follow.
