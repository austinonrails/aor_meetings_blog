## We are trying Meetup.com for Austin on Rails

We're trying something new. We've [moved meetings over to meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/Austin-on-Rails/). Please sign up (it's free) and join the group.

If you're wondering, yes there is an October meetup. We will be talking about [Progressive web apps and gRPC in Ruby](https://www.meetup.com/Austin-on-Rails/events/244130655/). Join us, and don't forget to RSVP on meetup.
