We’ve got a treat for you this month which is a little bit off the beaten path for us…a talk on MacRuby. It’s definitely a Ruby topic which has a [lot of interest](http://twtpoll.com/wjdlid) in our community, nonetheless.

### MacRuby

Ruby is not only a great language for doing web application development, but is garnering great fanfare recently as an new tool for doing full blown applications development for desktop client software as well. Tools like IronRuby on the PC and [MacRuby](http://www.macruby.org/) on the Mac make the task of writing a desktop application as fun if not more fun than doing web apps and with many of the same advantages. In this talk we look at MacRuby and how it can be used to create full blown Mac desktop apps while using and talking to many of the same libraries and tools you use to do web apps with Ruby.
