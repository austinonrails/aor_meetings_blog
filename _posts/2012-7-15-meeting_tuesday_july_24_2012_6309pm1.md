Our Lightning Talks last month set Capital Factory on fire with Mando on the mic. If this programming thing doesn’t work out, there’s always a life of standup comedy for Mando waiting. This month, we’re extremely pleased to welcome a special guest, author and well-known Rubyist Steve Klabnik out of the Pittsburgh area. Super psyched to have him in Austin and sharing his perspective with us on the latest developments in web application development, and particularly APIs.

## Designing Hypermedia APIs - Steve Klabnik

In this talk, Steve will explain how to design your APIs so that they truly embrace the web and HTTP. Just as there’s an impedance mismatch between our databases, our ORMs, and our models, there’s an equal mismatch between our applications, our APIs, and our clients. Pros and cons of this approach will be discussed, as well as why more people aren’t building APIs this way yet.

Steve Klabnik is a Ruby Hero, software craftsman, and an aspiring digital humanities scholar. He spends most of his time contributing to Open Source projects, and maintains both Hackety Hack and Shoes. He also teaches classes with Jumpstart Lab.

Join us at Capital Factory, on the 16th floor of the Omni Hotel downtown, for a fun-filled evening of Ruby, Rails, and community on the 24th!
