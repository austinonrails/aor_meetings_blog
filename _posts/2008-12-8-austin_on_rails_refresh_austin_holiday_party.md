December 9th, 7:00 p.m. [Buffalo Billiards, 6th and Brazos](http://www.buffalobilliards.com/austin/Images/map3.gif)

**Sponsored by [Appozite](http://appozite.com/), creator of [CheapTweet.com](http://cheaptweet.com/) and [ZiteFight.com](http://zitefight.com/).**

For December, Austin on Rails is shifting from our normal presentation-based format to a purely social gathering. We love to join up with other great tech groups in Austin, and this time we’ll be co-hosting the event with our friends at [Refresh Austin](http://refreshaustin.org/). There’s some decent overlap between our groups, and it’ll be a great chance to catch up with friends you may not have seen in a while as well as meet new friends as passionate about the Web and technology as we are.

This is a great chance to reflect on what we’ve accomplished in 2008 and to hatch plans for the year to come.

The gathering will be held upstairs at Buffalo Billiards. We will have a bartender up-top this time around, so it should be extremely convenient to grab the beverage of your choice. That said, as we don’t raise money, you’ll have to cover your own tab.

View the event and let people know that you are attending by visiting the event on on [Upcoming](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1405994). We look forward to seeing you there!
