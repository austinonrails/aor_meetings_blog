Howdy Austin Railers!

This coming Tuesday will be our first time on our new schedule (4th Tuesdays), which was selected by our membership as the best night for us to gather.

We are are going to bring together two tastes that taste great together, Bootstrapping and Rails. We'll have two of the leaders in Bootstrap Austin (Bijoy and Edward) giving talks on bootstrapping and we'll be discussing how working with Rails can help you get that side project or software startup idea out of your brain and into the browser. We are also fortunate to have two bootstrappers, Damon Flowers and Dave Wolpert, sharing a brief overview of what they are bootstrapping, how it is going so far, and what tools they are using to build up their sites.

Bijoy Goswami develops universal models that help individuals and organizations unlock their fullest potential. He packages these models in stories, books, communities, training and web sites. A consummate evangelist for his various projects, he has been featured in local and national media.

Edward Cruz's day job is working as a grizzled IT veteran specializing in e-commerce implementations. His passion is in finding ways to extend current web technologies into everyday human endeavors in ways that are collaborative, cooperative, and progressive. His latest project, Molecular Thinking (http://www.molecularthinking.com), is an accidental web 2.0 site that enables collaborative online brainstorming and ideation.

Here's the rough agenda for Tuesday (with a little twist on our usual format):

7:00-7:10 Welcome and Announcements  
7:10-7:35 Bootstrapping 101 - Bijoy Goswami, [Aviri](http://aviri.com/)/ [Bootstrap Austin](http://bootstrapaustin.org/)  
7:35-7:45 Damon Flowers, [Dwellgo](http://dwellgo.com/)- Overview/Feedback  
7:45-7:55 Dave Wolpert, PubMaven - Overview/Feedback  
7:55-8:05 BREAK / GIVEAWAY  
  
  
8:05-8:30 Bootstrapping With Rails - Edward Cruz, [Molecular Thinking](http://molecularthinking.com/)/ [Bootstrap Austin](http://bootstrapaustin.org/)  
8:30-8:55 Meet and Greet (People Mashup - connect with bootstrappers in Austin)

Iâ€™m definitely looking forward to learning more about bootstrapping and how we as a group can help each other and others harness the power of Rails to create!

The meeting will be held at Datran Media at the corner of 7th and Brazos. Please try to show up around 6:30 so that we'll have time to get everyone shuttled upstairs. We'll meet at the bank of elevators just inside the door. Socialization practice to follow afterwards at a local pub.

Looking forward to seeing everybody!

Note: If you are interested in bootstrapping and you haven't yet watched [DHH at Startup School 2008](http://icanhaz.com/dhhmakesmoney), you totally should. Turn comments off, though. You'll see what I mean. ;-)
