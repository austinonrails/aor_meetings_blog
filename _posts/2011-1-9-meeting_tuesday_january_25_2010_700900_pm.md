Back in the saddle after the holidays and what has blown into town? Cedar pollen! Good luck out there folks…Looking forward to seeing you all again this month. We’re going to talk video games and telephony in Ruby. Should be a hoot.

### Writing Video Games in Ruby with Gosu - Mason and Garrett Hale

Writing video games in Ruby is a heck of a lot of fun and surprisingly easy. In this session you’ll learn everything you need to know to start writing your own video games using the awesome [Gosu library](http://code.google.com/p/gosu/). We’ll build a simple 2D game and cover all the basics of event loops, animation, collision detection, game controller support and audio and video effects along the way. Be sure to bring your laptop to play (or build) along. By the way, this is a great session for kids who are interested in getting into programming.

Mason Hale is CTO at [OneSpot](http://www.onespot.com), an Austin start-up that enables web publishers such as The Wall Street Journal Online and SFGate.com to curate and share the “best of the web” with their readers. Mason was previously Chief Technologist at frog design from 1998 to 2006, where he led their global digital technology consulting practice. Mason has been a professional web developer for over 15 years and has been building apps with Ruby and Ruby on Rails for 5 years. His latest project is [SwimTopia](http://www.swimtopia.com), the world’s friendliest swim team management solution. Mason enjoys spending time with his family, often working on projects with his 3 kids, Connor, Garrett and Katie.

Garrett Hale is currently a 7th grade student at Murchison Middle School. He likes to listen to music, build electronic circuits and throw the frisbee. In his free time, he builds Warcraft 3 maps, plays video games and is learning to write ruby programs. He once counted from 0 to 255 in decimal, binary and hexadecimal, for fun. His favorite toy is his soldering iron. When he grows up he wants “build things”.

### Prank Call Your Friends with Ruby - Mattt Thompson

Telephony is the new hotness. It’s true! With the rise of cloud-based services like Tropo and Twilio, it’s never been easier to experience the thrill of writing interactive phone trees. What fun! In this talk, we’ll cover the basics of telephony: what it is, how it works–that sort of thing. From there, we’ll use Rails and Sinatra to prank call your friends, tell a joke, and even be a MUD client.

Mattt Thompson (@mattt) is a Ruby hacker and iOS developer at Gowalla.
