Next week, we’re going to join up with the [Refresh Austin](http://refreshaustin.org/) group on Tuesday night (12/9 at 7pm), for pints of beer and billiards at [Buffalo Billiards on 6th](http://is.gd/9ZYU). It’s become a bit of a tradition in Austin on Rails to have a holiday party in December. It’s still geeking out, but just with more beer and bar games.

This is a low frills shindig conceived so we can meet some more good web peeps here in town and chill out as a group in a social setting.

I hope to have a few further details soon.

Hope you all can make it out!
