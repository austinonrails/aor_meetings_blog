Mark your calendars, folks. This month, weâ€™ve got Dallas Pool speaking about security (or the lack therof) in web applications, but especially how to build secure Rails apps. We also are fortunate enough to have Technoweenie (Rick Olson, a Rails core committer) coming up from San Antonio for an overview of some key aspects of the recently released Rails 1.1. Hope you can make it out to Frog Design (8th and Congress), as Austin On Rails continues to do its part to build Austin into a premier Rails development community.
