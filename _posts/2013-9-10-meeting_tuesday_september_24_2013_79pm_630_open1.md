Greetings Rails Aficionados!

It’s that time of the month again…We are meeting up for more Ruby/Rails software developer goodness and community buiding. Your conductor for this month is the Honorable Tim T. Tyrrell III. Hope to see you there!

**A Gentle Introduction to Outside-In Development - Tim Tyrrell**

Writing software can be a confusing and complicated process, where do you begin? Behavior-Driven Development is a way to identify business goals and then drill down into the features that deliver those goals. This is intended to be a “code heavy” talk that will show you a useful workflow for developing well-tested software with Cucumber, RSpec, and Jasmine.

Tim Tyrrell is a Chicago native living in Austin and works as a Senior Software Engineer for WellMatch. He gets a little too excited about pair-programming and unit testing but don’t let that scare you.

**Party like it's 1995: Dealing with low connectivity environments - Jonathan Spies**

The recent rise in mobile devices and usage have brought us back to a simpler time, when the internet was just info pages, bulletin boards, and email. Your connection could drop at any second, leaving you with half of an image or uncontrolled grunts in Warcraft.

If you’ve ever wanted to build an app for farmers in sub saharan Africa, scientists in Antarctica, or just let people use your app at a football stadium, you’ve got to deal with sudden connection loss. We will explore ways that we can tune our server APIs and architecture to handle our clients suddenly dropping off and popping back up later.

We’ll talk about:

• How to design around idempotency

• How to ditch templates and get the most our of Serializers

• How to use old technology to build more reliable systems

• How to piggyback off of other people’s success

• How to test low connectivity

Jonathan Spies works for Bypass Mobile, a company that really wants people to use their app at crowded football stadiums. It’s a mobile point of sale for sports venues and music arenas/festivals.
