## The Deal

This month, we’re going to combine two tastes that taste great together…Rails (the chocolate) and Entrepreneurship (the peanut butter). A lot of us probably have business ideas and we wonder if we should pursue them. But is a good idea enough? How will your business make money? Do you need funding? If you can’t do everything on your list, how do you find good people to help you achieve your goals? This meeting is intended to get the conversation about Austin-based Rails projects going, bring people together, and spur people to action.

## Meeting Details
 Frog Design at 8th/Congress 7PM - 9PM 
## Our Speaker
 Matt Cohen is a Reese’s Cup: a business technologist. He is an entrepreneur, consultant, and a Venture Fellow at G-51 Capital, a seed and early stage venture capital firm founded in Austin in 1997. At G-51, he evaluates investment opportunities and provides technology management support for G-51’s portfolio companies. He has consulted with companies nationwide on technology and business strategy, was Senior VP of Operations and CTO for New Century Network (NCN) in New York (a content and advertising network of over 150 online newspapers), and co-founded HoustonChronicle.com in 1994. He has a CS degree from Rice University, loves Ruby and Rails, and knows the reason for /dev/zero. 
## Hour One
 Matt will talk about the business side of your Rails project: its business potential, revenue options, and possible funding sources. 
## Hour Two
 We are going to open up the floor to anyone who is interested to pitch a Rails-based business idea you’ve been thinking about, getting feedback or soliciting help from Austin-based designers, coders, and entrepreneurs. Matt will offer his perspective on the pitches as well.
