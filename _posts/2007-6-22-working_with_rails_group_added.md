The [Working With Rails](http://www.workingwithrails.com/) site has been updated with a bunch of new features. One of them is a _Groups_ feature, so I decided to create the [Austin On Rails group](http://workingwithrails.com/group/4451-austin-on-rails) today. Feel free to join if you are a regular attendee of Austin On Rails.
