Howdy everyone!

Due to the Christmas holiday, we will be having a social event in lieu of a standard meeting. Normal meeting schedule resumes in January!

## Party!

It’s time for the Second Annual [Austin on Rails](http://austinonrails.org/) / [Refresh Austin](http://refreshaustin.org/) party and this time the fine folks of [WordPress Austin](http://www.meetup.com/austinwordpress/) will join us as co-hosts. Even better, the first 100 people to join us at the party will get a free drink thanks to our neighbor [Rackspace](http://rackspace.com/) (they’re right down the road in San Antonio).

There’s a lot of overlap between our groups, so this is a great chance to catch up with friends you may not have seen in a while as well as meet new people as passionate about the Web and technology as we are.

This is a great chance to reflect on what we’ve accomplished in 2009 and to hatch plans for the year to come.

## Food Drive
**To give back to the Austin community, please bring at least one non-perishable food item to the Austin on Rails/Refresh Austin/Wordpress Austin Holiday party. Cash donations for [CAFB](http://www.austinfoodbank.org/) will also be accepted at the door.**
## RSVP

While not required, it would be helpful if you could [RSVP on Facebook](http://j.mp/ra0912) so we know how many people are coming.

Event Details 7:00 - 10:00p.m. Tuesday, December 8th Buffalo Billiards, 6th and Brazos

We’ll be upstairs at Buffalo Billiards (top of the stairs, take a right) and we’ll have a bartender, so it should be convenient to grab a tasty beverage. That said, as we don’t raise money, you’ll have to cover your own tab (beyond the first free drink from Rackspace if you’re one of the first 100).

See you there!
