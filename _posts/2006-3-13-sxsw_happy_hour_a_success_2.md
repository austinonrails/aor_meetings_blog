After months of planning, last night we held the Austin on Rails SXSW Happy Hour and I think we can safely say it was a resounding success! I did not personally count how many people showed up, but I can safely say a few hundred happy SXSWâ€™ers showed up. Kudos to [Michal Buffington](http://www.michaelbuffington.com/), [Damon Clinkscales](http://www.damonclinkscales.com) and me (Rob Jones) for helping pull this off. I will post some pictures up on the Austin on Rails Flickr Account when I get a minute.
