Howdy Folks

We had an awesome meeting last month and a great turnout (50-ish). We even had a shar-pei attend the meeting. Yes, we are that welcoming. The January meeting not only marked our first meeting at the new space at Datran Media, it also served as the backdrop for a photo shoot and [article](http://www.statesman.com/business/content/business/stories/technology/01/28/0128ruby.html) by Lori Hawkins of the Austin American Statesman. It was nice to have our little group featured so prominently.

Here are a couple of followups that you might like:

- [Gregg's writeup of his visit to Austin on Rails (and Atlanta)](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/gsporar/archive/2008/01/more_ruby_tuesd.html)

Sun gave us some great prizes for the meeting (a few USB key drives and T-shirts), which was totally unexpected. Thanks Gregg and Sun!

Looking forward to the [February meeting](http://austinonrails.org/articles/2008/02/04/meeting-tuesday-february-12th-7pm), everyone!
