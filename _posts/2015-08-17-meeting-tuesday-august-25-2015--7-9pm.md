## Surviving the Framework Hype Cycle - Brandon Hays

Adding new technologies to your stack can have far-reaching implications for your product, team, and career. Trying to pick the "right" one can be confusing, or even infuriating. But don't flip that table, we'll use the "hype cycle" and the history of Ruby and Rails as a guide to help you understand which front-end and back-end technologies are a fit for your needs now and in the future.

A former marketer and tech analyst, Brandon now helps run The Frontside, an Ember.js and Rails consultancy in Austin.
