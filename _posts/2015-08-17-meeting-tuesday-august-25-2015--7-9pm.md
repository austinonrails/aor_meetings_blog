Beat the summer heat with two cool talks at the August meeting of Austin on Rails! Your emcee this month is Anthony Lewis.

## Behind the Scenes of My First Client Project - Ben Brumfield

How do you get a freelance gig and quit your day job? Once you've got it, how do you ship working software that satisfies the majority the stakeholders at your client? What are the mistakes first-time freelancers make, and how can you avoid them?

Ben Brumfield will reveal the technical and business lessons he learned from his first major client project, touching on collaboration, communication, specialization, and MongoDB optimization. Mostly, however, he'll go into detail on the mistakes he made and how the product was shipped despite them.

Ben started using Ruby on Rails in 2005 for a side project to his day job writing Oracle-heavy Java at a dot-com. Although a perpetual beginner at Rails, he was able to leverage that side project to go independent at the beginning of 2012. Since then, he has been an independent developer and consultant providing services to libraries, archives, museums, scholars, and genealogical organizations.

## Surviving the Framework Hype Cycle - Brandon Hays

Adding new technologies to your stack can have far-reaching implications for your product, team, and career. Trying to pick the "right" one can be confusing, or even infuriating. But don't flip that table, we'll use the "hype cycle" and the history of Ruby and Rails as a guide to help you understand which front-end and back-end technologies are a fit for your needs now and in the future.

A former marketer and tech analyst, Brandon now helps run The Frontside, an Ember.js and Rails consultancy in Austin.
