# Ch-ch-ch-changes

After a 2-year history of meeting at [Frog Design](http://frogdesign.com/) (thanks!), we’ve got new digs for Austin On Rails! We will be meeting a few blocks over at [Datran Media](http://datranmedia.com/) at [7th and Brazos](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&geocode=&time=&date=&ttype=&q=omni+hotel&near=701+brazos,+austin,tx&sll=30.26862,-97.74113&sspn=0.170795,0.332336&ie=UTF8&ll=30.268624,-97.741107&spn=0.010675,0.020771&z=16&om=1). The meeting room is actually on the 8th floor of the business tower of the Omni Hotel building. The elevator requires a keycard, so we will have to shuttle folks up as they arrive. For this reason, I am going to suggest that people show up at 6:30PM and meet at the elevators just inside the building at the corner of 7th and Brazos. This will give us adequate time to get upstairs and get set up for the meeting. The meeting will run from 7-9PM as per usual. I’d like to thank Josh Baer of Datran Media for offering up a conference room for Austin on Rails.

# Ruby and Rails Support in NetBeans IDE 6.0
 The NetBeans IDE was originally created as a tool for Java developers. For quite a while now, however, it has had support for other programming languages. In version 6.0, the NetBeans IDE added support for yet another language: Ruby and its framework Ruby on Rails. The features include a powerful editor, refactorings, hints and quick fixes, a gem manager, an interactive shell, a full-featured debugger, and more. This presentation includes numerous demos that illustrate the productivity boost you can get by using NetBeans IDE 6.0 as your development environment for Ruby and Ruby on Rails applications. 

Gregg Sporar has been a software developer for over twenty years, working on projects ranging from control software for a burglar alarm to 3D graphical user interfaces. His interests include user interfaces, development tools, and performance profiling. He works for [Sun Microsystems](http://sun.com/) as a Technology Evangelist on the NetBeans project.

# What's New in Ruby 1.9?

Released just this last Christmas, Ruby 1.9 is considered a “transitional” version towards 2.0 and includes several major and many minor changes to the language. This talk aims to get you up to speed on some new language features and the syntactic changes present in 1.9, with a quick overview of modifications to the standard library and notable performance improvements.

A Ruby developer since 2001, Bruce Williams has been pleased to see his favorite language rise out of obscurity the last few years -- and pay the bills in the process. A developer for [FiveRuns](http://fiveruns.com/), Bruce also does a bit of independent consulting, has contributed to or served as the technical editor for a number of Ruby and Rails books, speaks at conferences when inspiration strikes, and is an aimless open source hacker and language designer in his copious free time.
