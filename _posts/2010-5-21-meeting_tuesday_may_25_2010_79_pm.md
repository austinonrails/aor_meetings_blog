### Rails 3 Overview / Merb to Rails 3

Gowalla recently migrated a large project from Merb to Rails 3. This talk will cover some of the lessons they learned during that process, specifics of porting a project from Merb to Rails, as well as an overview of major Rails 3 changes.

John Critz has been professionally developing web and desktop applications for 10 years, and has been developing Ruby on Rails applications for almost 5 years. Rob Mack has been professionally developing web applications with Ruby on Rails for almost 5 years. He currently works at Gowalla.

### Setting up a Rails 3 app on Dreamhost

Dreamhost may not be the sexiest (or fastest) of places for hosting Rails apps, but sometimes you just need to stage something on the cheap. Or perhaps you have a client who's a Dreamhost customer and they aren't interested in moving. This talk will cover setting up the app in Dreamhost's control panel, installing Rails 3's new dependencies in your user dir, using Bundler to vendor your custom gems, and using Capistrano and Git to automate deployment.

Skip Baney is a software engineer living in Austin, TX. who likes solving problems and eating tacos. When he isn't looking at trains with his two sons, he writes web apps for OS X Server.

### Your Learnings

Anyone who wants to can share a Rails 3 learning with the group. No slides needed. Bring something cool along with you so we can all get better.
