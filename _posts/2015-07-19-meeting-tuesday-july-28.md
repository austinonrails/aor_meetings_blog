## Everything I Need to Know About Git I Learned from Hand Puppets - Lora L. Abe & Brad Fults

Have you ever wondered why a `git rebase` fails when all you want to
do is pull from the server? Or why people scream in horror if you
mention `git push --force`? Or how about just what exactly is going on
when you run a `git reset`? Come join us for a fun and in-depth tour
of what Git is doing behind the scenes while weâ€™re making wild
gestures at it with our hands.

[Lora L. Abe](https://twitter.com/dottedlinegirl) attended and taught for Dev Bootcamp in Chicago and SF
before joining Treehouse (the education site, not the hardware store)
to cultivate grass-fed organic gluten-free code. She thinks red pandas
and Newtonian mechanics and rocks are pretty neat.

[Brad Fults](https://twitter.com/h3h) has been writing software for humans over the past 570
megaseconds or so and has had terrible and wonderful experiences with
Git, Ruby and Rails. He enjoys well-crafted interfaces, excellent
names and useful commit messages. Quality is the name of his game.
