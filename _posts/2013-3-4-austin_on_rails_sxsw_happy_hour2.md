Greetings Rails Gentlefolk!

There are many visitors are coming to these lands and welcome them, we will! SXSW is about to get underway, and we just wanted you to know that we’ve created a gathering spot for the web geeks among us to grab a drink, some appetizers, and chat about web technology.

Please join us for our annual SXSW Happy Hour at Buffalo Billiards on Monday night, March 11, from 6-9PM. We’ve reserved [The Lodge](http://www.buffalobilliards.com/austin/tour_lodge.html), which has tons of billiards tables, shuffleboard, darts. There are also gaming consoles in the adjacent bar which will be fired up and ready to go.

We’ve invited bonafide web geek and designer [Alex Baldwin](http://www.alexbaldwin.com/about) (of [Console.fm](http://console.fm)) to DJ our event.

So please tell your web dev friends to help us to get the word out and [get your ticket today!](https://austinonrails.ticketbud.com/2013-sxsw-happy-hour).

Please pass along a big THANK YOU to our premier sponsors of the event, without whom this event would not be possible!
