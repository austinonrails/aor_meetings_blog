For those of you not attending SXSW Interactive, you might want to check out [Bar Camp Austin on Sat, March 11.](http://barcamp.org/BarCampAustin).

What is BarCampAustin? Think of it as a way to get the tech/geek community together in Austin during one of the coolest music and media events of the year; SXSW. Non-Austin equivalents? Well, Dallas beat us to it (not sure how that happened) but think: Usenix? SXSW Interactive? Burning Man? BarCampPaloAlto? Only one thing is certain: It's up to you to decide. The most important thing you should take away from the event? Relationships with other geeks!
