Spring is here and it’s becoming painfully obvious that I should stop dressing for winter. However, I rock the sandals all year long. Word.

We’re gathering together this month to talk about another Javascript framework for “rich Internet applications” called [ExtJS](http://extjs.com) and we’ll also review options for background processing in Rails when you need to pull a long-running task out of the HTTP request/response cycle.

### ExtJS and Rails, Sittin' In A Tree

This presentation will walk through the fundamentals of the ExtJS Javascript library. We will walk through how to tie an ExtJS grid to a Rails RESTful resource.

Ross Andrews is a Rails developer currently between projects. He has worked with Imagitek, Ltd. on web applications for the financial services, retail, and customer service industries.

### Background Processing In Rails

Background processing is an important tool in web development.  Some things just can’t optimized enough for the normal request/response cycle of a web site and need to be run asynchronously.  Rails doesn’t provide you with any real out of the box solution.  There are a lot of external options available and this part of Rails is lacking any real convention or standard.

In this presentation, we will talk about how to choose and implement a solution that fits your needs.  We will start with some basic options using built in Rails tools and we will cover some of the more popular solutions solutions out there such as BackgrounDRb, Background Job, Delayed Job, Workling and more.

Rob Mack has been working with Rails professionally on and off since 2005.  Rob currently works for VitalSource Technologies.
