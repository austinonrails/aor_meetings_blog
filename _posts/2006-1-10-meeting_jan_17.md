Twenty-six of us attended the [December meeting](/articles/2006/02/13/meeting-dec-13-at-7pm). After learning about Migrations and Ajax we went next door to Hickory Street and stayed til closing time. This month, we’re at the same place, but in a much bigger room!

### Presentations

#### The basics of Ruby and why it’s cool

Ruby is radically object-oriented, sophisticated, and flexible. After covering the basics of Ruby, Hal will discuss the dynamic nature of Ruby and why you should care. He will show how you can add methods at runtime, the power of open classes (running with scissors), and how to use the method\_missing method.
