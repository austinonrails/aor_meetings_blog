Austin on Rails is proud to present our sixth annual SXSW Happy Hour…from humble bootstrapped beginnings to a fully sponsored event we’re excited to be hosting it again. We’d like to extend a hearty thank you to our awesome sponsors for making this event possible this time around. All of these companies are hiring Rails developers, so please give them a look… [Capital Thought](http://capitalthought.com/), [Gowalla](http://gowalla.com/), [PeopleAdmin](http://peopleadmin.com/), and [Rackspace](http://rackspace.com/)!

We’re going to get together over at Buffalo Billiards on Saturday night (3/12) for some cold beverages and a geeky good time.

Please join us!

  [Party RSVP](https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=190450464316514) <— please share with other interested Ruby/Rails developers who will be in town! 

 Next month it’s…back to your regularly scheduled programming. The ever awesome Dave Rupert ( [@davatron5000](http://twitter.com/davatron5000)) is crafting together our April meeting! Ask him what’s up!
