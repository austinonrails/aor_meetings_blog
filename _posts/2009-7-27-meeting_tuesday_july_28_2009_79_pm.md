This month is all about you. We’re interested to know what you have been building, what have you learned lately, etc. Is there a neat little class you made or a trick you found?

Please step up and share [something with the group](http://wiki.github.com/austinonrails/members/mini-talks-july-austin-on-rails-meeting)!

We’ll also be hearing from Ross Andrews about his recent play with the [Dhaka Parser Generator for Ruby](http://dhaka.rubyforge.org/). Using Dhaka, we will go through building a lexer, parser, and evaluator for a small query language. Then we’ll tempt the demo gods and show a Rails application with a search system that utilizes our new language. No previous knowledge of lex/yacc is required, although a basic understanding of BNF and how a parser works is recommended. Ross Andrews is a Rails developer in Austin. He works for the SuperPoints Network, making Rails and Facebook applications
