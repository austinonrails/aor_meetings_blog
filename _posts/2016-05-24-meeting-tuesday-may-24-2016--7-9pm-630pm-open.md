##Hiring (and Keeping) Junior Developers — Justin Herrick

As the saying goes, "juniors juniors everywhere, but no one I can hire." Lets tackle the myths and realities of hiring and working with junior developers on a small team. Then spend time talking about interviewing, hiring, retaining, and mentoring junior developers. A code free and open discussion on the practice and practices needed to land the best talent of the future, today.

##Gone in 60 Milliseconds: Realtime with ActionCable

Nathaniel Jones takes us on a high-speed tour of Rails 5's flagship feature:
* What is Rails 5's ActionCable, and how would it make my customers' experiences better?
* What are ActionCable's components, dependencies, and deployment considerations?
* How does it operate under load?  What performance strategies can I consider to ensure high concurrency?

Even if you're planning to hang out with Rails 4 for the time being, ActionCable can be dropped into a Rails 4 stack with a couple of Gemfile lines. Come on by!
