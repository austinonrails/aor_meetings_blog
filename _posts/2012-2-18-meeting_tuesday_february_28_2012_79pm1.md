For February, we are going to address one of the core components of Rails from the very beginning: ActiveRecord. We will have an introduction to the topic as well as a deep dive on more complex data modeling issues. The organizer for this meeting is Mason Hale.

_Beginner Talk_

_Demystifying ActiveRecord — Anthony Lewis_

For many new Rails developers, their first exposure to Rails (and often Ruby) is through ActiveRecord and “magical” incantations like ‘has_many’ or ‘belongs_to’. In this talk, we’ll pull back the curtain on ActiveRecord and see what’s going on under the hood. We won’t assume any prior knowledge of Rails or ActiveRecord, but may skim over explaining methods and parameters which are already well documented elsewhere. Instead, we’ll focus on the “big picture”, identifying the main concepts and components and explaining how they fit together.

Anthony Lewis is an Internal Tools Developer at PeopleAdmin. Prior to that he was a freelance web developer and teacher.

_Advanced Talk_

_Taming Complex Data Models — Mason Hale_

The real-world is rife with complex relationships and arbitrary rules. As developers, we are often faced with the challenge of modeling and managing these complexities in our applications. In this talk, we’ll delve into some of the “hairier” complex data-modeling scenarios like hierarchies, N-way relationships, and aggregated data and explore some of the patterns and techniques to tame these wild beasts.

Mason Hale is the founder and CTO of TeamTopia, the company behind SwimTopia, the world’s friendliest swim team management solution. Mason was previously CTO at OneSpot and Chief Technologist at frog design. He has been working with Ruby on Rails since 2006.
