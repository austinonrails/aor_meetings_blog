Merry Christmas! Oops wait…wrong month. It’s 2010 folks…and it’s shaping up to be a good one for the Austin Rails community. Our community is stronger now than ever and we’ll continue with our work (ha! we are coding in Ruby after all) this year.

**Update: Michael Bernstein will not be speaking this evening.**
### Engineering Ruby & Rails for Performance - Michael Bernstein

ORMs, Stored Procedures (the devil?), laziness, n+1 query problems, side effects, eagerness. These words may seem quite disparate - but in reality they all intersect when one starts worrying about performance and the considerations and compromises that accompany performance. These and many other paradigms will be discussed in relation to Ruby & Rails with the focus on maximizing performance.

Michael is a Senior Software Engineer at Apartment Home Living, part of the Apartments.com family. He attended The Ohio State University, graduating in 2004 with a B.S.E.C.E in Electrical and Computer Engineering. When not coding, Michael enjoys gaming with his wife Alicia, solving Project Euler mathematics problems, going to art museums, and watching the Buckeyes dismantle PAC-10 teams.

### Scalable Ruby Processing with EventMachine - Mike Perham

In this talk, we’ll learn how event-based programming solves a number of Ruby VM limitations and makes IO-intensive data processing (like with Amazon AWS or web/RSS crawling) much more efficient.

Mike is a software developer at OneSpot. He’s the maintainer of memcache-client, the Ruby client used by Rails to talk with memcached, and the author of data_fabric, the database sharding plugin for ActiveRecord._
