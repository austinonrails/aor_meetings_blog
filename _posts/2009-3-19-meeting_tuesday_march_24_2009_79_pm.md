So, [SXSW Interactive](http://sxsw.com/interactive) is **over** and it was good.

Particularly, I heard that the [Austin on Rails SXSW Happy Hour](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1820347/) sponsored by [OtherInbox](http://otherinbox.com/) and [FiveRuns](http://fiveruns.com/) was good. In years past, we’ve skipped the March meeting because we used to do mid-month meetings and it always coincided with the festival. Now that we’ve adjusted to Fourth Tuesday, we will be having our regular meeting this month. Wow, seeing you guys two times in one month! Remember, you can always come out to [Cafe Bedouins](http://cafebedouins.com/) to work on your projects on Tuesdays at Thunderbird if you would like as well.

Please check out [OtherInbox](http://otherinbox.com/) and [FiveRuns Dash](http://dash.fiveruns.com/), which are both now available to the public. They are both great tools by Austin companies using Ruby and Rails.

Ok, so off to the races with this month’s meeting. We’ve got some interesting topics lined up and also a kickin’ demo of the new Austin on Rails Members/Topics app that Justin Britten and Brownell Chalstrom have put together for us.

## Memcached and Rails

Mike Perham will show you how to speed up your Rails site significantly with memcached. We’ll cover database caching, page and template caching, how to keep your cache in sync and best practices.

Mike is a software developer at [OneSpot](http://onespot.com/). He’s the maintainer of memcache-client, the Ruby client used by Rails to talk with memcached, and the author of data\_fabric, the database sharding plugin for ActiveRecord.

## Wandering A Bit Off The Beaten Path To Build Your App

Hayes Davis will discuss using readily available (but slightly off the beaten path) tools and libraries to build a simple application that does something reasonably practical. He’ll touch on using the Twitter API, Sinatra, the Tokyo Cabinet key-value database, Mike Perham’s memcache client and others to demonstrate a useful Twitter-based application that ought to withstand some real-world use.

Hayes is the co-founder and CEO of Appozite, a company building products that integrate ecommerce and social software in ways that don’t suck. Appozite’s first product is [CheapTweet.com](http://cheaptweet.com/), a search engine for deals on Twitter. He’s a Java refugee who used to build stodgy enterprise stuff and made the switch to Ruby (and Rails) when he founded Appozite last year.

## Meeting Time and Location

We will meet at OtherInbox (enter through the stairs of the Omni Building at 7th and Brazos and head up the elevators to the 8th floor) from 7-9PM on March 24, 2009. Socialization practice will follow after the meeting at B.D. Riley’s.

Looking forward to seeing you! (again)
