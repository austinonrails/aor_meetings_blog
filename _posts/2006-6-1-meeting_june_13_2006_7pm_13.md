Come on out to Frog Design for a local RailsConf preview. Local Railers Damon Clinkscales and Jim Freeze are going to share their talks with us and will be looking for feedback.

#### Rails and Asterisk Get A Dental Office Talking by Jim Freeze
 
 

Automation of Medical and Dental offices will be a $25 Billion business in 2007. But today, the online presence of most offices is non-existent.

This talk is how we have changed that for two offices and how Ruby on Rails, coupled with Asterisk (an open source PBX), can significantly impact re-appointment, patient communication and office workflow.

In addition, we look at how Rails and Web 2.0 open the door to make Medical/Dental Web Applications a reality.

#### Agile Databases with Migrations by Damon Clinkscales

Database migrations are often a pain in the neck. Fortunately, Rails includes several new features to help keep your database agile along with your code.

In this talk, weâ€™ll walk through several example migrations, discuss how to work with legacy databases, and outline a set of migration best practices and gotchas to keep you on top of your game.

**UPDATE: Damon has posted his [RailsConf slides](http://damonclinkscales.com/past/migrations-at-railsconf/) on his [web site](http://damonclinkscales.com/).**
