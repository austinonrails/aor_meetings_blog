##It's All About Dem Bots — Tim Scott

Did you notice that everyone's talking about bots all of the sudden? Tech Crunch recently proclaimed that "Bots Are The New Apps." Facebook just announced at F8 that bots are are coming to Facebook Messenger. Bot stores are popping up everywhere. Some say that bots will even supplant search.

Meanwhile Slack continues to take over group collaboration.

Let's create a simple Slackbot in Ruby. It's easy with the slack-ruby-bot gem. We'll hook it up to a Slack group and deploy it to Heroku. We'll talk a little about the bot landscape and the future of bots.

Tim Scott is full stack developer, freelancer and sometime entrepreneur.

##The Original Skunk Works (preview of RailsConf talk) — Nickolas Means

Long before Agile and Lean became buzzwords, a scrappy group of aerospace engineers at Lockheed's Skunk Works were using similar practices to produce some of the most amazing aircraft ever built. The famous U-2 spy plane, the SR-71 Blackbird, and the F-117A Stealth Fighter are among the incredible planes the engineers at Skunk Works produced under impossibly tight deadlines and very limited budgets.

What can we learn from the stories of these amazing planes and the engineers who built them? Let’s go back to our roots and let the original experts teach us about building awesome stuff together.

Nickolas Means is a coder, truth-seeker, and VP of Engineering at WellMatch Health.
