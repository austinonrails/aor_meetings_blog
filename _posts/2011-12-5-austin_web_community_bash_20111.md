# Austin Web Community Bash

Tuesday, December 13, from 7-9 p.m. Buffalo Billiards (6th and Brazos)

Yes folks, It’s [that time of year again](http://refreshaustin.org/bash)! Come on out Tuesday, December 13, 2011, for a year-end gathering with many of the other tech and web meetups from around town.

Catch up with old friends and make new ones. Thanks to our awesome sponsors, we’ll have a sizable bar tab for the night.

Admission: At least one canned food item for the Capital Area Food Bank

I’d like to personally extend a special invitation to Gowalla employees (past and present), especially those who are moving to Palo Alto, to come out and let the Austin web community say our goodbyes and do our well wishing in person.
