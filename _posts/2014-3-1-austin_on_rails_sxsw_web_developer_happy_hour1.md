Please join us on the Monday of SXSW for good conversation, appetizers, and a night out without the laptop. Buffalo Billiards has tons of games, such as darts, billiards, and shuffleboard. Relax in a chill and fun environment with other geeks and plenty of room to move about the cabin.

We’ve been running this party for nine years now, and this easily the best party for the _ [HTTP](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html) _ set.

Web **developers** of all stripes are welcome! Invite your dev friends. Web Developers are free (see the event description for more information.)

Looking forward to seeing you there!

**We could not put on this event without the generous support of our sponsors.**
