Mr. Justin Britten will be your esteemed emcee for the evening and we’ve got a couple of great presentations from the Austin on Rails community lined up.

### Installing the Revenue Gem: Subscription Billing in Rails

Actually, there is no such gem!  If only subscription billing in Rails were that easy.  Barry Cox, of TweetRiver, and Justin Britten, of Prefinery, will cover the many options when it comes to collecting money for your Rails app.  They’ll examine Spreedly, CheddarGetter, PayPal, Amazon and even how to roll your own code using ActiveMerchant and a payment gateway.

Barry Cox is the VP, Technology at PeopleAdmin and a co-founder at TweetRiver. Barry likes building things. At work it’s typically enterprise software. At home, projects in the backyard. In his spare time he likes building web-based side businesses. Barry’s previous experience includes founding Uplogix, an Austin-based network management company, and various stints in senior management, development, and product management with Cybermark, Drake Industries, Coremetrics, and Alterpoint.

Justin Britten is he Founder of Prefinery, an Austin-based startup that helps companies launch a private beta for their Web application in minutes by outsourcing the whole beta invite process.  He’s been working with Rails for nearly 3 years.

### Integrate HTML5 / CSS3 into Your Work Flow Today

HTML5 provides semantic layout tags which help us keep our views clean and readable as well as the new AUDIO and VIDEO tags. While CSS3 gives us a ton of new selectors for advanced styling, CSS Rounded Corners!!! and multiple backgrounds!

HTML5 and CSS3 are two exciting emerging standards coming our way in the immediate future. In 30 minutes you will learn the new tags for layout and microformats HTML5 offers, how to obtain browser support for the new tags in legacy browsers, and we will give an overview of the new selectors and properties of CSS3.
