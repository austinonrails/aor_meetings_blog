Please come out and mingle with all the Ruby and Rails enthusiasts visiting town for the [SXSW Interactive Festival](http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive). We are taking over _The Lodge_ at [Buffalo Billiards](http://buffalobilliards.com/austin) at 6th and Brazos. This years party is going to be bigger than last year and all the food and drink is on the house, courtesy of [FiveRuns](http://fiveruns.com/). Please let us know if you are coming by registering at [upcoming.org](http://upcoming.org/event/151373/) so weâ€™ll have an idea of the headcount. **SPECIAL NOTE:** If you do not have a badge, you must also email me at scales pobox.com to RSVP for entrance to the party.
