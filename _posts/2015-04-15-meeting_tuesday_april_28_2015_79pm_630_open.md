Rails Friends! 

Please join us for the April Edition of Austin on Rails. Your Rails conductor this month is Damon Clinkscales.

## Using React.js with Rails - Shah 

Shah will be talking about React, a new JavaScript library from Facebook, and how you can use it with Rails. React.js is a library for building user interfaces, and allows you to take care of the view layer in your Rails app in a more elegant way. We will be going through some slides as well as some live coding, so bring your laptops!

Shah is a software developer with passion for Rails, currently working for Atlantic.net as well as consulting.

## Continuous Deployment of Rails Applications - Diane Cessna

Continuous deployment and continuous delivery are often used interchangeably. They might sound very similar, but there are huge process and culture shifts needed in order to switch from continuous delivery to continuous deployment. At Sharethrough, we recently implemented continuous deployment for all of our applications and services, but our large Rails application was the most challenging to convert. This talk will cover how to get started with continuous deployment, the specific tools and gems we’re using, and the lessons we learned along the way. Most importantly, we’ll talk about how continuous deployment has improved team morale and the joys of committing to master.

Diane Cessna is an Engineering Team Lead at Sharethrough, a leading native monetization company for the open web, where she leads development for the platform used to create and manage native ads. Diane holds a B.S. in Computer Science from Indiana University and has over 7 years of professional web application development experience.
